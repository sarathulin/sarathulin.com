Transactional Analysis, also known as TA, is a theory & model for
understanding human personality, relationships & communication. It was first
developed in the 1950s by Canadian-born U.S. psychiatrist Eric Berne (1910–
1970). The theory & models are very hands on & easy to understand for all
types of people & one doesn’t have to be a trained psychologist to follow the
terminology.
