This is the time to focus on you, and the challenges you are facing, what problems you want to work on and how to develop your own inner strength.

Do you have a specific problem or topic you want to talk about deeper in a safe and calm setting or a goal you want support reaching, then
you can book a one to one session with me. Here you get the opportunity  to look at a problem you are dealing with or a goal you want to
achieve and use hands on tools & models to understand them and work towards a reaching a solution. I am bound by EATAs rules of ethics 
(European Association of Transactional Analysis) which includes confidentiality.

Rate: 40€ / 60 Minutes (regular), 30€ / 60 Minutes (student)

Place: Walk & Talk, where you feel comfortable or online via Teams.

Book a first 30 minutes appointment free of charge in which we can get to know each other a bit and see if we would be a good match.
