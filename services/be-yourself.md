Sisterhood. Empowerment. Support. Inspiration. Sharing narratives. Learning or relearning what we once new about ourselves. International.
These are some keywords describing what my workshops offer.

Using Transactional Analytical Models to explain topics like how we communicate in a healthy way, how to say NO without feeling guilty
and why we tend to keep having the similar kinds of conflicts with people throughout the years, what is negative and positive stress and 
how to get control of it and much more are made to support you in YOUR personal journey to live a more balanced and authentic life. The
goal is that you understand that you have all the answers that you need within yourself and with some practice you are able to live the
life you want.

Knowledge is the key to change & growth!
Come and check a workshop out that you find interesting. Who knows, maybe you will learn something new about yourself.
