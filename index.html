                Hello dear visitor & welcome to my website.<br /><br />
                <div style="max-width: 600px; text-align: left; margin: auto;">
                    Are you looking to talk to someone in English about a certain situation or life in general?
                    Are you interested in developing your soft skills, such as communication, stress or conflict management?
                    Then you have come to the right place.
                </div><br/>
                <h3>How can I help?</h3><br/>
                <div style="max-width: 600px; text-align: left; margin: auto;">
We are often quite critical to ourselves so I like to remind you to be kind to yourself and celebrate
the small victories along the way.
                    <br /><br />
<div style="text-align: center; color: blue">“If we can create an inner atmosphere where we feel safe yet accountable, I believe we have a
winning concept for positive change.”</div><br />

By using theories, models and methods from Transactional Analysis (TA) & Social Psychology <b>my part</b> is to
provide you tools for understanding, coaching you where you want & need to go, and give you a safe place for
exploration. <b>Your part</b> is to be open & honest, and decide the pace & direction.<br />

Many women who come to me are mothers and have a need to talk about their situation and all
the stress and sorrows it brings being a parent. On top of that they are often not originally
from Germany. This can put another level of pain on raising a family (sometimes very) far
away from their own support system they grew up in. These women find it helpful to have a
place to go where they can openly talk about their sadness & fear and also sometimes anger.<br /><br />
Since I myself am an international mother who gave birth to both my children in Germany without
any German language skills, I can relate in the difficulties other women might be facing.
Please know that you are not alone!<br /><br />
Of course not all who come to me want to talk about their problems. Some seek to bounce ideas and
thoughts with me and want to talk about goals & solutions. I want to inspire & be a mirror for them
and help them to first understand their blockages and then to create a step by step
process on how to move forward. <br /><br />

The reason women look for my services are quite similar. There is the need to understand themselves and
their relationships better so they can have a higher quality with their loves ones, co-workers & simply
live their lives to the fullest. Common topics are communication skills, stress management, conflict management & decision making in the personal-, work related- and cultural field.

<br /><br />
<div style="text-align: center; color: blue">“It is natural to feel strange when breaking old patterns.
    Allow yourself to feel uncomfortable until you're don't.”</div><br />

One of the unique approaches with TA is that the relationship is based on an equal level, giving
both parties the possibility to have a saying in the therapy. This supports an authentic &
transparent communication as well as relationships and is highly appreciated by my clients.
                    <br /><br />
                    <div style="text-align: center; color: blue">
“There is no quick fix in changing our behaviour that we have had for a long time. It takes time and
effort to change but when you are ready to make that decision, you can reach new places and
                        shape your life the way you want.”</div>

                                        <br/>My name is Sara Thulin and I am a Certified Transactional Analysis Practitioner (read more what TA in "About My Work"), Counselor & Trainer. I am a mother of 2 and live since 2012 with my family in Germany.<br/><br/>
                                        It was not always obvious how I would manage to integrate myself into the Germany nevertheless finding a job that I liked or even loved, with no knowledge of the language and often with very little willingness to understand the culture I had come to live in.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        I was often angry for living in a place where things seemed so strange and foreign, scared for not fitting in or finding my place or even people I could identify with & sad for the life and people I had left behind and all the things I would now miss & not be a part of for not living there anymore.
                                        It took me many jobs, (even two new careers) and 7 years, learning the language, one marriage & 2 children to get my first real German job. I was exhausted even before I started. My batteries were empty from raising 2 children into a place I myself was not sure I even wanted to be in. But I also didn’t know where else to go. Sweden, my home country also seamed far away and foreign & I found myself stuck in a limbo.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        One day I had a conversation with myself to ask what do you really wanted to do and I answered
                                        <br/><br/><div style="text-align: center; color: blue">“ I want to work with international women and support them in their personal development and journey”.</div><br/>
                                        I then founded a group called Women of the World but often I was alone or maybe only one person came. We met at different restaurant to get to know the city of Erlangen better but some how I wasn’t able to reach out to the women. It has taken 3 years and the group is now flourishing and thriving with amazing, inspirational & supporting women from all over the World who live in Erlangen.
                                        <br/>
                                        During this time I started to think that I wanted to add something more to my degree as a social psychologist and found the personality theory Transactional Analysis. It had practical tools and models that were easy to understand for me and it felt like I had found my niche. I started a 2 year certification to become a Transactional Analytical Practitioner for and finished end of 2019, right before the Pandemic hit. When I was done I asked myself how do you want to live your life from now on and I quickly answered
                                        <br/><div style="text-align: center; color: blue">“Authentically”</div><br/> without really knowing what that meant. I decided that I would let it be a process and take one step at the time and I would use it as a part of my own development narrative as inspiration to someone at some point.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        During this time I was still working at my first real German job and I started to realize that I wanted to support women in a more hands on kind of way and I started to have a conversation with myself again. I asked myself the same question as the first time: What do you really want to do and I answered
                                        <br/><br/><div style="text-align: center; color: blue">“I want to work with international women and support them in their development and journey, using the knowledge I have of TA and Social Psychology to live more authentically. And I want to do it through one to one sessions, in a deeper and closer setting and I want to do it in groups where I can create content that women who have similar stories to mine can come and get inspired, get support and motivation”.</div><br/>
                                        Somehow I was now more clear on what I wanted and how I would do it. I was already supporting women in my job but it got clear to me that it is my calling and has always been. So I took a leap to start working independently and I love every second of it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Best regards,<br/>

This enables me to feel free to reflect, to be curious about myself, partly for myself and partly together with others, which gives me both aha-experiences and insights about myself.-->
